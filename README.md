## ⚙️ Config (`config.yml`)

### Sections

- `txt_fields` -> controls fields written in output txt files
- `notifications` -> Discord/Telegram settings and mode
- `display` -> console UI mode (`log` or `simple`)
- `retries` -> retry attempts for retryable request/proxy errors

### Example

```
txt_fields:
  plan: true
  email: true
  country: true
  owner: true
  free_slots: true
  invite_link: true
  address: true

notifications:
  webhook:
    enabled: false
    url: ""
    mode: "full" # full | invite_address_only
  telegram:
    enabled: false
    bot_token: ""
    chat_id: ""
    mode: "full" # full | invite_address_only

display:
  mode: "log" # log | simple

retries:
  error_proxy_attempts: 3
```

## 🔁 Retry Behavior

- Retries per cookie: `retries.error_proxy_attempts`
- Uses different proxies across retries when available
- Retry status codes: `403`, `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`
- Retryable failures exhausted -> `broken/`
- Invalid/dead cookie -> `failed/`

## 🧠 Email Dedupe (Built-in)

- First valid account for an email is kept
- Next valid cookies with same email are marked as duplicates
- Duplicates are skipped and counted in stats (no output file)

## 🔔 Notification Modes

### `full`

- Sends full account details
- Sends output txt file
- Discord/Telegram formatting optimized

### `invite_address_only`

- Sends family invite-focused message only for eligible family owners
- Includes free slots, invite link, and address
